= Inputs - a primer

== Types
An input type is just that. A type of input. Number, Date, Date Time. More complex types will come into existence.

A type file ( date-time-type.ts, date-time-type.edit.component.ts, for example ) is referring to to a configuration of one of these types. One can edit the configuration parameters for the type


== Ival ("Instance Value")

An Ival refers to 'instance value'. A populated object that is of type 'DateTimeIval' is a *value* that matches an *instance* of DateTimeType.


An example. Some arbitrary  'SimpleNumberType' can be configured with max, min, and default. So an instance of NumberType would look like:

```js
let numberTypeInstance = new SimpleNumberType({ max: 100, min: 0, default:10.1});
```

This means that an *instance* of SimpleNumberIval is any number between 0 and 100. Generally speaking, 'default' on the FooType is going to be a representation of the FooIval.
