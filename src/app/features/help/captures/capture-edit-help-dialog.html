                 don’t want to spend much time on this each night - just a rating from one to ten of awesomeness. Your

              <p>To make this happen we have to <strong>configure</strong> our Capture. We’d give it a nice name, such

              <p>You can add a description if you like. Perhaps use the field to describe your own meanings for each

              <p>We’ll need two <strong>Inputs</strong>. The first Input is provided by default - the 'When' value.
                 'When'
                 simply records the Date and Time. When you’re <strong>adding</strong> a point you can change the value
                 -
                 for example, if your day was so amazing that you were too exhausted at the end of it to log it, you can
                 log
                 it the next morning and set the value of 'When' to the night before.</p>

                 page - that’s what you’ll do on the 'Add Entry' page. But you can set the <strong>default
                                                                                                   value</strong>.
                 The default value is what you will see each time you go to add a new entry for this Capture.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>The provided 'When' input is already set to default to 'now' - meaning that when you open the Capture
                 to
                 add a new entry, the 'When' field will be set to the current time.</p>

                 a
                 descriptive Name and a 'When' field.
                 This kind of Capture is wonderfully simple to log: just create a Home Screen shortcut that opens
                 directly
                 to the 'Add Log' page for your capture (don’t worry
                 we describe how to do this on the 'Add Log' page!). Tap the Home Screen shortcut, makes sure you landed
                 in
                 the right Capture and click 'Save'.</p>
