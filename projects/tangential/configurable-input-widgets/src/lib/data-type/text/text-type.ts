/**
 * == Reporting
 * Text types can represent things like:
 *  * Quick notes, such as idea, or a Capture for 'I met a new person', and the persons name is the value.
 *  * Mood / Feeling
 *  * Name of a food eaten
 *  * Name of a place visited.
 *  * Name of a medication taken.
 *
 *
 * === Charts/Graphs
 * A text value is hard to plot in isolation. But consider the case of 'met a person'. In this case we could
 * plot time on the horizontal axis and number of people met per range. This would become a stacked bar chart?
 *
 * For something like mood, let's consider two cases:
 *   1) The capture is 'When' and 'Mood'. In this case we can have an arbitrary number of points in a day,
 *   and the user is probably going to want to correlate this value to time of day.
 *   - Go with a scatter plot, with days of the week on the X and hour of day on the Y, with the field as the point
 *     label.
 *   2) The capture is 'When', 'Feeling<text>', 'Weight<numeric>'.
 *
